type alias Set =
    { rank : Int
    , parentId : Int
    }


{-| Create a new DisjointSet of the specified size. The subsets are assigned
integer ids starting at 0.

    init 8 -- create a disjoint set of 8 independent subsets numbered 0-7
-}
init : Int -> DisjointSet
init n =
    Forest (Array.initialize n initSet)


initSet : Int -> Set
initSet id =
    { rank = 0
    , parentId = id
    }


-- Create a set with a negative rank. Used to prevent a set with an
-- out-of-range id from being selected as the parent tree in a union.
invalidSet : Int -> Set
invalidSet id =
    { rank = -1
    , parentId = id
    }


{-| Find which subset the given id's set belongs to.

    find 2 (init 5) |> fst -- 2
    find 2 (union 3 2 (init 5)) |> fst -- 3

Note that this function returns a tuple with the first element containg the
result of the find and the second a new DisjointSet object. This is because
`find` performs an optimization which changes some internal structure (without
changing the sets themselves).

For simplicity, if the id asked for is not valid, the result is always that same
value.

    find 100 (init 5) |> fst -- 100

This behavior may change in the future, but I wanted to avoid muddying the api
with a `Maybe` result here.

{-| Join two subsets into a single subset.

            union 0 1 (init 3)

            find 0 set

    in
        ( p0 == p1, p1 == p2 ) -- ( True, False )

In the above example, you can see that keeping up with the set as it updates can
start to get a little cumbersome. Check out the `DisjointSet.Computation` module
for some tools that help deal with this.
